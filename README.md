My Initial Solution:

I've adopted a **lean approach**. Focusing on understanding the problem more before committing to a particular direction or more advanced solution. While still having something pretty neat working.

To run the code, simply execute the following command:

```bash
node command_line_version.mjs stock.txt
```
